# üë• Team Profile Generator

## üî® Task

To create a Node.js command-line application that allows a user to enter information on their development team and returns a webpage with the information they entered dynamically added. This project utilizes the [Inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js#readme) package to prompt the user, including input validation and question sets dependent on the users answers. It also uses ES6 classes to create objects based off the information entered.

This application is complete with testing by the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) package.

## üìé How to Use

Make a directory on your computer and clone this repository into it. In the terminal for the project directory, run `npm install` to download the Inquirer and Jest packages.

Once you are ready to run the program, enter `npm start` in the terminal, and answer the on-screen questions. Once you end the program, wait to see if you received a confirmation message declaring that your webpage is ready. If so, navigate to the `/dist` folder where you will find an `index.html` and `style.css` file. Double check that all of your information is correct, then you are done!
